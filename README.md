# 🎪 FAKE VIRUS COMEDY PAGE 🎪

## ⚠️ THIS IS A JOKE! NOT A REAL VIRUS! ⚠️

This is a **harmless comedy webpage** that pretends to be a virus for entertainment purposes only. It's just HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no actual viruses, malware, or harmful code!

## 🤡 What It Does (All Fake!)

- Shows fake "hacking" terminal with dad jokes
- Pretends to steal your bank account (shows $69,420 → $0)
- Random meme phrases like "PICKLE RICK!" and "NO BITCHES?"
- Fake Blue Screen of Death
- Screen "seizures" with flashing colors
- Stupid popup messages
- Gay pride messages 🏳️‍🌈

## 🎭 Live Demo

Visit: https://jguida941.github.io/virus-comedy-page/

## ⚡ WARNING: Contains flashing lights and screen effects!

## 💡 How It Works

It's just a single HTML file with:
- CSS animations for visual effects
- JavaScript for fake terminal and popups
- No server code, no actual hacking, no data collection
- Everything runs locally in your browser

## 🚫 Legal Disclaimer

This is purely for comedy/entertainment. Do not use to actually scare people or claim it's a real virus. That would be mean and potentially illegal.

## 📝 License

Feel free to fork and make your own joke virus! Just keep it clearly labeled as a joke.
